The 1st phase of the interview process is a take home exercise and will require you to go through a ReactJS Component that can be used to build a form with flexible structure.


The task will be to:


1a. Describe what it does in a Google doc AND
1b. Implement a new edit entry type that looks like the below, calling it `PillList` You’ll need fix all the import errors first.


The deliverable would be to (1a) send me the document + (1b) code for review alongside a screen recording of it working on a web page.



2. In the same Google doc above, describe the steps you would take to implement a more flexible `ItemList` where an “item” can be any fixed schema object. Examples of `ItemList` use cases:
   A form for doctors signing up for a platform where they are putting in a list of 10-50 patients, specifying every patient’s name, bio, profile photo, age.
   A form for car dealerships to upload inventory of 50-1000 cars, specifying every car’s brand, model name, year, available colors, engine type, transmission type, safety ratings and horsepower.
   In other words, `ItemList` is an abstract list type that can accommodate many items with each item having 1 or many fields each.


3. If #1 and #2 above goes well, we'll do a call where you'll screenshare and we'll talk through another case question about how to extend the component.




This is to test your ability to understand a complex frontend component, your communication, and general taste for design.


Here’s a link to download the component: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1EdWtT98rqN6tgWmXPZUsvwdUHCLzMjhV/view?usp=sharing


Let me know if you have any questions, and let's schedule #3 once you're finished with #1 and #2. Good luck!
